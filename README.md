## Interesting/ Notable Achievments

1. Created a script to track multiple of the same card (by creating a new ImageTracker when we start tracking, and destroying it when we lose track). 
	* This is notable because there doesn't appear to be any examples of this being done; but with lots of people asking if it is possible to do (with all of them being told it isn't possible).
